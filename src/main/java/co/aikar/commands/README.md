# ACF for MiniCraft

This has to be in the co.aikar.commands packages because of access restrictions in ACF...

This can be easily used by other clean java projects, the only outside dependencies are CommandSource and the colors, 
which can easily be adopted.

Ill make a PR to the main repo someday....
